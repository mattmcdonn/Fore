This application is called Fore. Fore is a golf tracking app that allows a user to track thier golf statistics while playing on the field. The app can track up to four players,
where it will intake data from the each player (it will track each players stroke count on each hole). The app is capable of keeping track of the players scores for every hole and each par.
At the end of the game, the statistics will be organized into a nice scorecard layout. The player may chose whether or not they would like to save their statistics to the iOS devices Cloud
stored data. Fore offers two modes, regular (stroke play), or skins, which are two of the most popular game types in golf, where different algorithms are used to track and calculate scores.
The applcation also has a tab for the users achievements, which is just a little fun addition to display for the user. This version of Fore will receive minor updates for bug fixes, and may
receive additional features in the future. Feel free to view the code and possibly download it to your own mobile device to give it a try!
